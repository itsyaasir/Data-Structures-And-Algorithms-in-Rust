Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.

The O(n) 
// O(n) - Linear - For Loops , while loops through n items

// n is the number of items in the collection or array or list or vector.
// The number of operations do not depend on the size of the input and is always constant.

The O(1)
In this Big O notation , operation is always constant regardless of the value being searched,
For example when finding an index
