# My Algorithms and Data Structures Practice Repo
Welcome to my repository for practicing algorithms and data structures! In this repo, you will find examples of algorithms and data structures that I have implemented while learning and studying computer science.

## Why I created this repo
I created this repo to document my progress as I learn and practice algorithms and data structures. By sharing my implementations, I hope to receive feedback and advice from others, as well as to provide a reference for myself and others who are learning these concepts.

## What will you find in this repo?
In this repo, you will find my implementations of various algorithms and data structures. This includes:

- Basic data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks
- More advanced data structures, such as binary trees and hash tables
- Common algorithms for searching, sorting, and other operations on data structures

## Getting started
To get started, you can browse the directory structure to find the algorithms and data structures that you are interested in. Each implementation includes a brief explanation of the concept, as well as the code and any relevant test cases.

Please note that these implementations are for reference and educational purposes only, and may not be suitable for use in production environments.

I welcome any feedback or contributions to this repository. Happy learning!
